# chroma_laph_builder

Build scripts for chroma_laph and its dependencies.

This set of scripts will dowload, build, and install all the dependencies
of chroma_laph on. The user is required to give the desired location of
the stack install. This is done in the build_stack_XXX.sh script.

After that, simply run the desired stack script. Be aware that you will need to
give a password for teh actual chroma_laph download.

Good luck!
